Hi! I'm Ailene, and I'm a researcher on human cognition and multisensory perception.

I am currently a fourth-year PhD student in Caltech's Computation and Neural Systems program, working with [Prof. Shinsuke Shimojo](https://neuro.caltech.edu/). Before Caltech, I conducted vision research with [Prof. Dorita Chang](https://www.changlab.hk/) and sleep research with [Prof. Shirley Li](https://sleep.hku.hk/).
